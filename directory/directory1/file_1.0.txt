1. Testing terminology
1.1. Unit tests and unit testing
A unit test is a piece of code written by a developer that executes a specific 
functionality in the code to be tested. The percentage of code which is tested by unit tests 
is typically called test coverage.

A unit test targets a small unit of code, e.g., a method or a class, (local tests).

Unit tests ensure that code works as intended. They are also very helpful to ensure that the code still 
works as intended in case you need to modify code for fixing a bug or extending functionality. Having a high 
test coverage of your code allows you to continue developing features without having to perform lots of manual tests.
